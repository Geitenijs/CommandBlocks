# CommandBlocks
[SpigotMC Resource Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/62720/)

CommandBlocks allows you to automatically execute commands when players use signs, buttons, pressure plates and other blocks! This can be quite useful when you want special actions to trigger if a player interacts with specific blocks!
